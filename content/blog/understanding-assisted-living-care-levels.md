## Making the Right Choice for Your Loved One

When a family member begins needing more support with daily activities, it's natural to feel uncertain about the next steps. Understanding the different levels of care available in assisted living can help you make an informed decision that ensures your loved one receives the right amount of support while maintaining their independence and dignity.

At our Temecula and Murrieta communities, we've helped hundreds of families navigate this important transition. Here's what you need to know about care levels and how to determine which is the best fit.

## The Three Main Levels of Care

### Level 1: Light Assistance

This level is ideal for seniors who are largely independent but benefit from some daily support. Residents at this level typically:

- Manage most personal hygiene independently
- Need occasional reminders for medications
- Enjoy social activities and community dining
- May need help with housekeeping and laundry
- Benefit from transportation services for appointments

**Who it's best for:** Seniors who want the social benefits and security of community living without extensive hands-on care.

### Level 2: Moderate Assistance

Many residents fall into this category, requiring regular help with certain activities while maintaining independence in others:

- Daily assistance with bathing, dressing, or grooming
- Medication management and monitoring
- Help with mobility, including walking and transfers
- Regular health monitoring and wellness checks
- Coordination with physicians and specialists

**Who it's best for:** Seniors who need consistent daily support but don't require around-the-clock supervision.

### Level 3: Full Assistance

This comprehensive level of care is designed for residents with more complex needs:

- 24-hour supervision and support available
- Complete assistance with all activities of daily living
- Specialized memory care services when appropriate
- Advanced medication management
- Close coordination with healthcare providers
- Physical and occupational therapy support

**Who it's best for:** Seniors with significant health challenges, cognitive decline, or those recovering from hospitalization.

## How We Assess Care Needs

When you visit our communities, our care team conducts a thorough assessment that includes:

1. **Physical Health Evaluation** - Understanding current medical conditions, medications, and mobility levels
2. **Cognitive Assessment** - Evaluating memory, decision-making, and communication abilities
3. **Daily Living Skills Review** - Observing ability to perform routine tasks independently
4. **Social and Emotional Needs** - Considering personality, interests, and social preferences
5. **Family Input** - Listening to observations from those who know your loved one best

> "Every resident is unique, and cookie-cutter care simply doesn't work. We take the time to understand each person's history, preferences, and needs before creating their personalized care plan." — Jennifer Sims, RN

## Signs It May Be Time for More Support

Families often wonder when the right time is to consider assisted living or to increase the level of care. Watch for these indicators:

- Difficulty managing medications correctly
- Noticeable weight loss or poor nutrition
- Declining personal hygiene
- Increased falls or balance issues
- Social isolation or withdrawal
- Forgetting to pay bills or manage finances
- Unsafe driving or getting lost in familiar places
- Caregiver burnout among family members

## The Benefits of Getting the Right Level of Care

When seniors receive appropriate support—not too much, not too little—remarkable things happen:

- **Increased confidence** in daily activities
- **Better health outcomes** through proper medication management and nutrition
- **Reduced fall risk** with appropriate mobility assistance
- **Improved social connections** through community activities
- **Peace of mind** for family members knowing their loved one is safe

## Flexibility as Needs Change

One of the advantages of choosing a quality assisted living community is the ability to adjust care levels as needs evolve. Our team continuously monitors each resident's wellbeing and can seamlessly increase support when needed—without requiring a move to a different facility.

This "aging in place" approach means your loved one can build lasting relationships with staff and fellow residents, maintaining stability during a time that can otherwise feel uncertain.

## Questions to Ask When Touring Communities

As you visit assisted living options, consider asking:

- How do you assess and determine care levels?
- What training do your caregivers receive?
- How quickly can you adjust care if needs change?
- What is your staff-to-resident ratio at each care level?
- How do you communicate with families about their loved one's care?
- What activities are available for residents at different care levels?

## Take the Next Step

Understanding care levels is just the beginning. The best way to determine what's right for your family is to visit a community, meet the staff, and see the care in action.

We invite you to schedule a personal tour of our Murrieta or Temecula locations. Our team will answer your questions, conduct a complimentary needs assessment, and help you understand all your options.
